Hello!

This is my Lab Report Week 1. 

Step 1: Set up your CSE15L Account.

  In order to set up your CSE15L Account, click on the link: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php 
  
  After accessing the link, there should be a "New Student" Log in (below the Account Lookup). Following the instructions, use your LAST name and student ID to log in.
  
  You should see your username starting with cs15lwi23..
  
  Next, you need to change your password by clicking a link called "change your password". Follow the instructions and change your password. 
  NOTE: it is important to press enter (NOT press the button)
  

Step 2: Remote Connecting: 

  Open your terminal/console. In your console, type ssh cs15lwi23---@ieng6.ucsd.edu  
  Replace the dashed-lines with your last 3 alpha-numeric letters of your username. Press Enter. 
  
  Note: If the terminal asks for your password again, you might need to wait up to 15 minutes for your password in step 1 to update.
